# UFOs

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a fun, aesthetic, and filterable
web app made with Javascript and html. The final product allows you to
filter by data, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

## Results
Interacting with the web app is simple, you pick your search criteria:

and your results are displayed on the side!

## Summary
While this table is very easy to use and looks nice, there is a drawback
in that if you wanted a new article and title at some point, you'd have to
write the title and article directly into the HTML as it is now. If you 
wanted to fix this, the article and title could be saved as a link instead
and referenced in the HTML instead of needing to be completely re-written
each time.
